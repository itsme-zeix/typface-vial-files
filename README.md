# zeix-pcb-firmware

This repository contains firmware and configuration files for custom keyboard PCBs I've designed.

Some of these projects may already exist in QMK or VIA. Others are either not yet added, not intended to be, or are designed specifically for use with Vial.

Feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to contribute or suggest features.
